Computing newforms of level Q2^2*Q11. Dimension of the space: 376
There are 14 newforms to eliminate.

Eliminating forms by checking whether K is included in the field of 
coefficients...

...done!

The forms at level Q2^2*Q11 whose coefficient field contains K are the forms 
labelled:
[ 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]

The degrees of the coefficient fields of these forms are:

[ 5, 10, 25, 25, 50, 60 ]
