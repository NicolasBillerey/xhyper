Computing newforms of level Q2. Dimension of the space: 2
There is 1 newform to eliminate.
Performing standard elimination for 1 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 3, 
23 ]

Checking form no 1

Dealing with q = 3
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Prime exponent(s) remaining to eliminate = { 5, 29, 31 }
Dealing with q = 23
Prime exponent(s) remaining to eliminate = { 5, 31 }
Form no 1
with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^2 + x - 1 over 
the Rational Field
is not eliminated for prime(s) : { 5, 31 }
*************************************************************

Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 5 with set of auxiliary 
primes { 23 }

Dealing with q = 23
Prime ideal(s) remaining to eliminate = {
    Prime Ideal of OF
    Two element generators:
        [5, 0]
        [2, 1]
}
The form with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^2 + x 
    - 1 over the Rational Field
is not eliminated for 1 prime ideal(s) above : 5

Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 31 with set of auxiliary 
primes { 23 }

Dealing with q = 23
Prime ideal(s) remaining to eliminate = {
    Prime Ideal of OF
    Two element generators:
        [31, 0]
        [18, 1]
}
The form with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^2 + x 
    - 1 over the Rational Field
is not eliminated for 1 prime ideal(s) above : 31
*************************************************************

We now compute m(O) in the notation of Kimball Martin.

We first compute Zeta_K(-1):

33*x + 20
1.117587090E-8

This shows that Zeta_K(-1) = -20/33.

We now compute m(O):
m(O) = 155/132

Since 5 and 31 divide the numerator of m(O), we have eliminated all forms at 
level Q2.

Computing newforms of level Q2*Q11. Dimension of the space: 10
There are 2 newforms to eliminate.
Performing standard elimination for 2 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 3, 
23 ]

Checking form no 1

Dealing with q = 3
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Prime exponent(s) remaining to eliminate = { 5, 109 }
Dealing with q = 23
Form no 1 is eliminated
*************************************************************

Checking form no 2

Dealing with q = 3
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Prime exponent(s) remaining to eliminate = { 7, 13, 127 }
Dealing with q = 23
Form no 2 is eliminated
*************************************************************

We have proved that for p > 3 prime, there are no primitive solutions (a,b,c) to
x^11 + y^11 = z^p such that 2 divides a+b.
