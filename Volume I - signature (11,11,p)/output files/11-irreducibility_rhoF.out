The field K is generated by w with minimal polynomial:
x^5 + x^4 - 4*x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x + 1

The unit group of K is:
Abelian Group isomorphic to Z/2 + Z + Z + Z + Z
Defined on 5 generators
Relations:
    2*U.1 = 0
and is generated by {-1, eps1, eps2, eps3, eps4} where
eps1 = w^4 - 3*w^2 + 1
eps2 = w^2 + w - 1
eps3 = w
eps4 = -w^4 - w^3 + 3*w^2 + 3*w


The integer B for the number field K from Theorem 1 in [Freitas-Siksek] (JTNB, 
2015) is:
1

This rules the case p > 19.

We now deal with p = 5, 7, 11, 17 and 19.

Its torsion subgroup is: 
Abelian Group isomorphic to Z/3
Defined on 1 generator
Relations:
    3*T.1 = 0
For each torsion point, we compute its j-invariant:
(0 : 1 : 0) -89915392/6859
(5 : -10 : 1) -89915392/6859
(5 : 9 : 1) -89915392/6859

Next we show that there is no a,b in Z such that j(F_{a,b}^{(delta)}) = 
j(F_{a,b}) = j0 with j0 in  [ 16581375, -3375, -32768, -121, -24729001, 
-882216989/131072, -297756989/2, -884736 ]

We do it by checking that there is no degree 1 factor in the factorization of 
the numerator of j(F_{a,b}) - j0

We display below the degrees of such irreducible factors:

For j0 = 16581375 we have: [ 4, 4, 4 ]
For j0 = -3375 we have: [ 4, 4, 4 ]
For j0 = -32768 we have: [ 12 ]
For j0 = -121 we have: [ 12 ]
For j0 = -24729001 we have: [ 12 ]
For j0 = -882216989/131072 we have: [ 12 ]
For j0 = -297756989/2 we have: [ 12 ]
For j0 = -884736 we have: [ 12 ]

This rules out the cases where p = 5, 7, 11, 17 and 19.

We finally deal with the last remaining case p = 13.

There modular curve X_0(26) has genus 2

It has the following 4 cusps:
[
    [
        Place at (1 : 0 : 0)
    ],
    [
        Place at (0 : 0 : 1)
    ],
    [
        Place at (0 : 1 : 1)
    ],
    [
        Place at (1 : 1 : 0)
    ]
]

The quotient of the modular curve X_0(26) by the Atkin-Lehner involution w_2 is 
the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 5/2*x^2 - 39/16*x - 169/16 over K

The torsion subgroup of E/K has order 3.

We check that E/K has rank 0...

We compute the inverse images of each of the three K-rational points on E under 
the map X -> E.
{@ (0 : 1 : 1), (1 : 1 : 0) @}
{@ (0 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 0) @}
{@ @}

They correspond to the four 4 cusps on X.
