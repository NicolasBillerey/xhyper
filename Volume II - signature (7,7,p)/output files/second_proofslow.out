The prime p = 5 is eliminated for form no 3 (but the prime p = 13 still 
survives).

For each form f at level Q2*Q3*Q7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 
for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K:

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose 
existence is predicted by Martin's result.
It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.
