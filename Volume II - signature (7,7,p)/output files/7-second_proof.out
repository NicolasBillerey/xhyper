The prime p = 5 is eliminated for form no 3 (but the prime p = 13 still 
survives).

For each form f at level Q2*Q3*Q7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 
for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K:

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose 
existence is predicted by Martin's result.
It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.

Computing forms at level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2...
Done !
There are 61 newforms at level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2.
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.114

Eliminating forms by checking whether K is included in the field of 
coefficients...
Done!


The forms at level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 whose coefficient field contains K are the forms
labelled:
[ 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 33, 38, 41, 42, 45, 46, 47, 
48, 51, 57, 58, 60, 61 ]


The degrees of the coefficient fields of these forms are:
[ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 12, 12, 15, 18, 18, 21, 21, 36, 36, 
54, 54 ]


We first determine which of these forms are quadratic twists by the mod 7 
cyclotomic character (which is quadratic when restricted to K) of forms in the 
two possible smaller levels.

Computing forms at level Q2^2*Q3...
Done!
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.116

Degrees of the coefficient fields of the forms at level Q2^2*Q3:
[ 1, 3, 3, 9 ]

Computing forms in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7...
Done!
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.117

Degrees of the coefficient fields of the forms at level Q2^2*Q3*Q7:
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 12, 12, 12, 15 ]

We already conclude that forms at level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 with coefficient field 
containing K of degree > 15 do not arise from lower level.

We look for the forms in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 whose coefficient field contains K 
and has degree <= 15 and such that they arise by quadratic twist from level 
Q2^2*Q3 or Q2^2*Q3*Q7.

Checking for forms that arises from twisting forms at level Q2^2*Q3 by comparing
the coefficient fields:
Form no 38 with field of degree 9 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 4 in level Q2^2*Q3
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

Checking for forms f in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 that arise by twisting forms at level
Q2^2*Q3*Q7 by comparing the coefficient fields for forms f such that [Kf:Q]>3 
and by comparing the Fourier coefficient at 11*OK for forms f such that [Kf:Q] =
3 (i.e. Kf is isomorphic to K):
Form no 26 with field of degree 3 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 9 in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Form no 16 with field of degree 3 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 10 in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Form no 33 with field of degree 9  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  15  in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Form no 42 with field of degree 12  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  17  in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Form no 41 with field of degree 12  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  18  in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Form no 45 with field of degree 15  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  19  in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

We conclude that at the level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 all the forms of degree 9, 12, 15 and
two of degree 3 arise from smaller levels by quadratic twist.

It remains to determine which forms in level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 are quadratic twists 
of each other by the same character:

Forms no 46 and 47 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 18.
Forms no 60 and 61 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 54.
Forms no 48 and 51 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 21 containing K.
Forms no 57 and 58 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 36 containing K.
Next we show that the remaining 10 forms of level Q2^2*Q3*Q7^2 with Deg(Kf) = 3 
appear in 5 pairs of quadratic twists:
Form no  12  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  28
Form no  17  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  24
Form no  18  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  19
Form no  20  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  21
Form no  22  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  23
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

We first eliminate the forms that arise from a smaller level by the quadratic 
twist corresponding to L/K where L = Cyclotomic(7).

Form no 38 is eliminated because it is a quadratic twist of a form at level 
Q2^2*Q3, while the conductor of the Frey variety at Q7 has exponent 1 or 2 up to
quadratic twist.
