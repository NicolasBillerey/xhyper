Form no 3 eliminated

Only form no 2 is not eliminated. Computing the difference of the a_3 
coefficients, we check that it corresponds to the Frey curve E(1,0) :
Form f no 1 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -2
Form f no 2 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = 0
Form f no 3 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -a - 1
Therefore, the mod p representations of E(a,b) and E(1,0) are isomorphic. 
In particular, 7 does not divide a+b and hence we are in Case (1).

Form f no 7 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -a - 1
Form f no 8 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -a - 1
Therefore, the mod p representations of E(a,b) and E(1,-1) are isomorphic. 
In particular, 7 divides a+b and hence we are in Case (2).

The prime p = 5 is eliminated for form no 3 (but the prime p = 13 still 
survives).

For each form f at level Q2*Q3*Q7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 
for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K:

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose

It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.
