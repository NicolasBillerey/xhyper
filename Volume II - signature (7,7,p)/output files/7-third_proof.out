* We eliminate in turn each of the following cases:                   *
* (1) 4 does not divide ab and 7 does not divide a + b using E        *
* (2) 4 divides ab and 7 does not divide a + b using F twisted by -7  *
* (3) 2 does not divide ab and 7 divides a + b using F                *
* (4) 2 divides ab and 7 divides a + b using C                        *

* (1) We use E to eliminate the case               *
* 4 does not divide ab and 7 does not divide a + b *
****************************************************


Assume for a contradiction that 4 does not divide ab and 7 does not divide a + b
The mod p representation of E(a,b) arises in level 2^3*7^2 = 392

Form no 8 eliminated

Only form no 1 is not eliminated. Computing the difference of the a_3 
coefficients, we check that it corresponds to the Frey curve E(1,-1) :
Form f no 1 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = 0
Form f no 2 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -2
Form f no 3 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = 1
Form f no 4 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -4
Form f no 5 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -1
Form f no 6 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = 2
Form f no 7 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -a - 1
Form f no 8 : a_3(E) - a_3(f) = -a - 1
Therefore, the mod p representations of E(a,b) and E(1,-1) are isomorphic. 
This is a contradiction since by assumption 7 does not divide a + b.

* We have eliminated all the forms.      *

for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K:

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7

Eliminating form 19
Performing standard elimination with 1 prime ideal(s) above 5
We still have to eliminate exponents p = { 5, 11, 17, 59, 89, 137, 173, 193, 
1815911 }
Performing standard elimination with 1 prime ideal(s) above 13
We still have to eliminate exponents p = { 5 }
Performing standard elimination with 1 prime ideal(s) above 11
Form eliminated !

******************************************
* We have eliminated all the forms.      *
* Therefore, we have ruled out case (4). *
